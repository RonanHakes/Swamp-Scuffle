Swamp Scuffle is cool gaming to play with friends yes yes will be so good

Fix:

- Make goliath frog sprite bigger
- Add a close window button (menu maybe?)
- Implement egg sprites
- Add animations
- Undisable disabled units in turn loop
- Finish Spring Peeper, and Blue poison Arrow Frog , and african bullfrog
- Add eggs, tadpoles, and layegg and metaphorize methods
- meantoad gains attackRadius when 1hp
- make meantoad button
- make it so frog can only lay an egg once
- make tile be greyed if frog is disabled

For future:
- change how the backend works to remove boardX and boardY redundancies and replace with instances of Tile or something idk but there is definitely a better way of doing this
- Add a main menu
- Add online functionality :o
- Give the game a better way of signaling to the player that they are doing something wrong

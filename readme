Swamp Scuffle is cool gaming to play with friends yes yes will be so good

Fix:

- Finish african bullfrog
- fix start turn button not changing to end turn button fast enough
- make buttons square
- make sure energy is working properly


For future:
- make scream disable blue poison arrow buff
- add starter frog every 20 turns
- change how the backend works to remove boardX and boardY redundancies and replace with instances of Tile or something idk but there is definitely a better way of doing this
- Add a main menu
- Add online functionality :o
- Give the game a better way of signaling to the player that they are doing something wrong

Battle Frogs is cool gaming to play with friends yes yes will be so good

Fix:

- The way GoliathFrogs are being painted should be replicated for all units (widthMultiplyer should prolly be moved to the Unit class and then calculated in the unit constructor)
- Make a way of detecting when a specific tile is clicked on (way easier than doing it for frogs themselves rather use the tile its on)
- Make goliath frog sprite bigger
- Make turn loop work
- Add a close window button (menu maybe?)
- Implement egg sprites
- Add animations
- implement energy in backend
- Undisable disabled units in turn loop
For future:
- change how the backend works to remove boardX and boardY redundancies and replace with instances of Tile or something idk but there is definitely a better way of doing this
- Add a main menu
- Add online functionality :o
- Give the game a better way of signaling to the player that they are doing something wrong

Swamp Scuffle is cool gaming to play with friends yes yes will be so good

Fix:

- Make goliath frog sprite bigger
- Finish Spring Peeper, and Blue poison Arrow Frog , and african bullfrog
- fix game end when only egg or tadpole is left on one team
- make sure buffing works correctly
- fix start turn button not changing to end turn button fast enough
- fix selection menu highlighting yellow for starter frog turns
- add tile selection for mean toad button


For future:
- change how the backend works to remove boardX and boardY redundancies and replace with instances of Tile or something idk but there is definitely a better way of doing this
- Add a main menu
- Add online functionality :o
- Give the game a better way of signaling to the player that they are doing something wrong

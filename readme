Battle Frogs is cool gaming to play with friends yes yes will be so good

Fix:
- See lines 40-43 in Window class i am going insane
- Look into the issue i mentioned in the comment on line 27 of Window
- Will have to figure out how to not restart the whole game every time the window gets resized; <-- this seems pretty important
- The way GoliathFrogs are being painted should be replicated for all units (widthMultiplyer should prolly be moved to the Unit class and then calculated in the unit constructor)
- Make a way of detecting when a specific tile is clicked on (way easier than doing it for frogs themselves rather use the tile its on)
For future:
- change how the backend works to remove boardX and boardY redundancies and replace with instances of Tile or something idk but there is definitely a better way of doing this

Battle Frogs is cool gaming to play with friends yes yes will be so good

Fix:

- The way GoliathFrogs are being painted should be replicated for all units (widthMultiplyer should prolly be moved to the Unit class and then calculated in the unit constructor)
- Make a way of detecting when a specific tile is clicked on (way easier than doing it for frogs themselves rather use the tile its on)
- Make goliath frog sprite bigger
- Make turn loop work
For future:
- change how the backend works to remove boardX and boardY redundancies and replace with instances of Tile or something idk but there is definitely a better way of doing this
